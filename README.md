# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the Vine program. Specifically, I am analyzing the reviews of shoes brought through Amazon. In completing the analysis, I have conducted the ETL process and used PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.

## Results
- There were 22 Vine reviews and 26,987 non-Vine reviews.
